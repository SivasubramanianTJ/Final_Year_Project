# OptimizedSRGAN Image Super Resolution

A web application that uses SRGAN (Super Resolution Generative Adversarial Network) to enhance image resolution by 4x.

## Key Features

- 4x image upscaling using advanced GAN architecture
- Built on RRDN model with GAN-optimized weights
- Simple and intuitive user interface
- Flask-based web application

```

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the application:

   ```
   python app.py
   ```

3. Open your browser and go to:
   ```
   http://localhost:5000
   ```

## How It Works

The application uses a pre-trained SRGAN model to upscale images. Upload an image through the web interface, and the model will process it to create a 4x larger version with enhanced details.

## Technical Implementation

The implementation uses TensorFlow and the ISR (Image Super Resolution) library with an optimized RRDN model architecture trained with GAN techniques for better perceptual quality.
